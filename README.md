## [Foursqure Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/foursquare-location-matching/overview/description)

The goal of this competition is match POIs together. Using a dataset of over one-and-a-half million Places entries heavily altered to include noise, duplications, extraneous, or incorrect information, it is expected to produce an algorithm that predicts which Place entries represent the same point-of-interest.


### Data

They are three datasets provided: train, test, and pairs. Train and Test data have the same format with train having an extra columns (point_of_interest) where it identifies the point that refers to the entity. For each entity we have the name, url, address, country, zip_code, and etc. The pairs dataset is built upon the training data just matching the pairs and seeing if they are the same or not.
